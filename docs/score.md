# 打分标准 Scoring Guidlines

## Presentation

**Quick check: Abstract, Introduction, Figures.**

- 5: Definitely stealing some ideas for how they explained things or made their figures. I wish my papers looked this good.
- 4: Maybe a figure or explanation I'll remember and use later.
- 3: I can write as good as it.
- 2: Kind of a pain to read, or the figures are confusing/ugly. Hard to tell what's going on easily.

## Evaluation

**Check the end: Experiments, Results, Reproducibility.**

- 5: Solid real-world tests. NVDA could actually use or bet on.
- 4: Solid tests with real hardware. But the setup is not real-wrold ready.
- 3: Okay tests with open source simulators. The results aren't obviously wrong.
- 2: Okay tests with close source simulators. The results aren't obviously wrong.
- 1: The results just don't make sense.

## Novelty

**Compare with related papers.**

- 5: Totally new idea.
- 4: New take on old ideas, or combines them smartly.
- 3: An old idea applied to a totally new area/topic.
- 2: An old idea applied to a similar problem.
