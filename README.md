# About NLR

The New Lemon Review is a paper review list maintained by LEMONADE at Peking University. The list is updated regularly by prospective and current PhD students. The list is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the quintessential research ideas in the field of computer architecture and systems.

## Guidelines for Adding Papers

1. Do not add workshop papers, posters, or abstracts. Add peer-reviewed full papers. Add preprints when they are important and have not been published in a conference or journal.
2. Sort the papers by year under the same subsection.
3. Do not use general tags like "performance" or "architecture", which should be in the subsection title. Use specific tags that are novel concepts proposed in the paper, such as "xxx algorithm", "yyy model", "zzz architecture", etc.
4. Authors should include the affiliations of the corresponding author, or the last author if the corresponding author is not specified.
5. There should be **at least 2 papers** under the same subsection. If there is only one paper suitable for the subsection, find another paper, or connect the paper with a link from or to another paper in the list.
6. There should be **no more than 5 papers** under the same subsection. If more than 5 papers are suitable for the subsection, create a new subsection, or mark the most recent papers as delete.
