# About NLR

The New Lemon Review is a paper review list maintained by [LEMONADE](https://www.youwei.xyz) at Peking University. The list is updated regularly by prospective and current PhD students. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the quintessential research ideas in the field of computer architecture and systems.

## Guidelines

### What papers should be included?

1. Do not add workshop papers, posters, or abstracts.
2. Add peer-reviewed full papers. Add preprints when they are important and have not been published in a conference or journal.

### How to organize the papers?

1. Sort the papers under the same subsection by year.
2. Authors refer to the **affiliation** of the corresponding author, or the last author if the corresponding author is not specified.
3. Do not use general tags like "performance" or "architecture", which should be in the subsection title. Use specific tags, like the words chosen by the authors to describe their contributions, such as "xxx algorithm", "yyy model", "zzz architecture", etc.
4. There should be **at least 2 papers** under the same subsection. If there is only one paper suitable for the subsection, find another paper, or connect the paper with a link from or to another paper in the list.
5. There should be **no more than 5 papers** under the same subsection. If more than 5 papers are suitable for the subsection, create a new subsection, or mark the most recent papers as delete.
