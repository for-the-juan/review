# New Lemon Review

The New Lemon Review is a paper review list maintained by LEMONADE at Peking University. The list is updated regularly by prospective and current PhD students in the LEMONADE group. The list is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the quintessential research ideas in the field of computer architecture and systems.

## Guidelines for Adding Papers

1. Add peer-reviewed full papers. Do not add workshop papers, posters, or abstracts.
2. Sort the papers by year under the same subsection.
3. Do not use general tags like "performance" or "architecture", which should be in the subsection title. Use specific tags that are novel concepts proposed in the paper, such as "xxx algorithm", "yyy model", "zzz architecture", etc.
4. Authors should include the affiliations of the corresponding author.
5. There should be more than 2 papers under the same subsection. If there is only one paper suitable for the subsection, find another paper, or connect the paper with a link from or to another paper in the list.
6. There should be no more than 4 papers under the same subsection. If more than 4 papers are suitable for the subsection, create a new subsection, or mark the most recent papers as "spillovers".
