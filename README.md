# About NLR

The New Lemonade Review is a paper review list maintained by prospective and current PhD students @pku-lemonade/phds at [LEMONADE](https://www.youwei.xyz), Peking University. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the quintessential research ideas in the field of computer architecture and systems.

## Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always check the guidelines before submitting a PR.

### What papers should be included?

1. Do not add workshop papers, posters, or abstracts.
1. Add peer-reviewed full papers. 
1. Add preprints only for LLM related topics.

### How to organize the papers?

1. Order:  Sort the papers by year (oldest first) in the same subsection .
1. Authors
    1. Use the **affiliation** of the **corresponding author** (or **last author**).
    1. Use standard, globally recognized abbreviations or universally known institutions. 
1. Subsections
    1. Place papers only in **Level 3** or **Level 4** subsections.
    1. Each subsection should group papers tackling a common challenge. Briefly state that challenge at the beginning of the subsection. 
    1. **Min 2 papers** per subsection. If only one fits, find a partner paper, or connect this paper to another subsection.
    1. **Max 5 papers** per subsection. If more fit,  split the subsection. 
1. Tags
    1. Use specific tags for catchy techniques or contributions, such as "xxx algorithm", "yyy model", "zzz architecture", etc.
    1. Don't use broad area tags ("performance" or "architecture").
    1. Don't use vague feature tags ("expresiveness", "scalability", "efficiency"). Good to use technique + feature tags ("xxx algorithm for scalability").
    1. Put quotes around potentially unclear acronyms ("XYZ framework") and explain them.
1. Links
    1. Connect related subsections with links. For example, connect hardware papers to related software papers if they share the same idea.
